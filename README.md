# start-me-up
This is my first Git Hub 'Hello World' account.

I have been coding seriously for about a year and a half now.
Primarily focused on MVC Web Applications in C# with Razor; JS; JQuery; AJAX; HTML5.
Primary IDE is Visual Studio (now 2015).
Additional tech I've been working with: Jenkins; Visual Cron 7; Git Extensions / Gerrit; SQL Server 2014.

Prior to this, I had worked as Quality Assurance for the same type of applications (good base for clean coding).
